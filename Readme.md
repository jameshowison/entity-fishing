# entity-fishing

*entity-fishing* performs the following tasks for 11 different languages:

* entity recognition and disambiguation against Wikidata in a raw text or partially-annotated text segment,
![entity-fishing](doc/images/screen11.png)

* entity recognition and disambiguation against Wikidata at document level, in particular for a PDF with layout positioning and structure-aware annotations,
![entity-fishing](doc/images/screen10.png)

* search query disambiguation (the _short text_ mode) - below disambiguation of the search query "concrete pump sensor" in the service test console,
![Search query disambiguation](doc/images/screen8.png)

* weighted term vector disambiguation (a term being a phrase),

* interactive disambiguation in text editing mode (experimental).

# Documentation

[Presentation of entity-fishing at WikiDataCon 2017](https://grobid.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/29-10-2017.pdf) for some design, implementation descriptions, and some evaluations.

The documentation of *entity-fishing* is available [here](http://nerd.readthedocs.io).

# Demo

For testing purposes, a public entity-fishing demo server (current version) is available at the following address: [https://cloud.science-miner.com/nerd](https://cloud.science-miner.com/nerd)

The query DSL and Web services are documented [here](https://nerd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/restAPI.html).

_Warning_: Some quota and query limitation apply to the demo server! Please be courteous and do not overload the demo server. 

# Benchmarks

![entity-fishing](doc/images/scores.png)

Evaluations above correspond to the "overall unnormalized accuracy" scenario in [BLINK](https://github.com/facebookresearch/BLINK#benchmarking-blink). entity-fishing performs at 0.765 F-score, as compared to 0.8027 for BLINK, a fine-tuned BERT architectures. *entity-fishing* surpasses BLINK for the dataset AQUAINT, 0.891 vs. 0.8588, and MSNBC, 0.867 vs. 0.8509, despite being considerably faster and lighter than BLINK (see below).

See the [evaluation documentation](https://nerd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation.html) and [Presentation of entity-fishing at WikiDataCon 2017](https://grobid.s3.amazonaws.com/presentations/29-10-2017.pdf) for more details. 

*entity-fishing* has been designed to be particularly fast for a full scale Wikidata-based entity disambiguation tool. On a single server, depending on the concurrency, it is possible to process from 1.000-1.500 tokens per seconds with concurrency 1 to 5.000 tokens per second for instance with 6 concurrent requests in English (and up to 2 times faster for other languages). 

# Some use cases

Some example of *entity-fishing* usages:

* Tanti Kristanti from [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr) used off the shelf version of *entity-fishing* in the [CLEF HIPE 2020 competition shared task](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2696/paper_266.pdf), ranking first at the Entity Linking task for English and second best for French, in F1-score.

* [Kairntech](https://kairntech.com) has integrated *entity-fishing* on their commercial platform [Sherpa](https://aclanthology.org/2020.iwltp-1.9.pdf) to support analysis and enrichment of textual content, since 2020. 

* [SEALK](https://sealk.co), which is commercializing a M&A industry recommendation system, scaled *entity-fishing* to more than 1 million fulltext news documents in 2020. 

* *entity-fishing* has been deployed in the DARIAH-EU and Huma-Num infrastructure in the context of the [OPERAS HIRMEOS EU project](https://www.hirmeos.eu) in 2018.

# Current version

*entity-fishing* is a **work-in-progress** side project! Latest release version is `0.5.0`. 

This version supports English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, Russian, Japanese, Portuguese and Farsi with an in-house Named Entity Recognizer available for English and French. For this version, the available knowledge base includes around 96 million entities from Wikidata - but you can create your own fresh knowledge base with the [GRISP](https://github.com/kermitt2/grisp) utility. 

**Runtime**: version `0.5.0` 2022, on a local machine (Intel Haswel i7-4790K CPU 4.00GHz - 8 cores - 16GB - SSD, 2015) for **English** (other languages are up to 50% faster - these runtimes do not include a 15s-30s initial server launch/start-up and are obtained with an empty cache and without LMDB pages pre-loaded in RAM memory).

* 800 pubmed abstracts (172 787 tokens) processed in 129s with 1 client (1339 tokens/s) 

* 4800 pubmed abstracts (1 036 722 tokens) processed in 168s with 6 concurrent clients (6171 tokens/s) 

* 136 PDF (3443 pages, 1 422 943 tokens) processed in 760s with 1 client (4.5 pages/s, 1872 tokens/s)

* 816 PDF (20658 pages, 8 537 658 tokens) processed in 1133s with 6 concurrent clients (18.2 pages/s, 7535 tokens/s)

**Accuracy**: F1-score for disambiguation only between 76.5 and 89.1 on standard datasets (ACE2004, AIDA-CONLL-testb, AQUAINT, MSNBC) - to be improved in the future versions.

The knowledge base contains more than 1.5 billion objects, not far from 15 millions word and entity embeddings, however *entity-fishing* will work with 3-4 GB RAM memory after a 15 second start-up for the server - but please use SSD!
